PHP:
  * Provide paths to all images & thumbnails
  * Provide only 4 (Config) containers each
  * Set containers to first images as these are most probably clicked first
  * What about caption??? Needs to be read server side except if I want to transition it whole to JS -> Read all captions and make most invisible

JS:
  * Click on image -> Reset containers
  * npics > 2 ? 0 = previous : 0 = current
  * Click on arrows / thumbnails -> same but maybe more intelligent (in case of arrows)?
  * Toggle caption visibility as is now
